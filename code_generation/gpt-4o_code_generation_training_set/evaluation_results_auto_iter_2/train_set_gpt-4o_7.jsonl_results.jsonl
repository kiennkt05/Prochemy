{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we need to consider two main cases:\n\n1. **Numbers that start with 1**: \n   - For an n-digit number starting with 1, the first digit is fixed as 1. The remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) such numbers.\n\n2. **Numbers that end with 1**:\n   - For an n-digit number ending with 1, the last digit is fixed as 1. The first digit (to ensure it's an n-digit number) can be any digit from 1 to 9, and the remaining (n-2) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are \\(9 \\times 10^{(n-2)}\\) such numbers.\n\nHowever, numbers that both start and end with 1 are counted twice in the above two cases. These numbers have the form 1xxxx...x1, where the first and last digits are 1, and the (n-2) middle digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are \\(10^{(n-2)}\\) such numbers.\n\nThe final count of numbers that start or end with 1 is the sum of the two cases minus the overlap:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 10^{(n-1)} + 9 \\times 10^{(n-2)} - 10^{(n-2)} \\]\n\nLet's implement this logic in the function:\n\n```python\ndef starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        # Special case: for 1-digit numbers, only 1 satisfies the condition\n        return 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers starting with 1\n    start_with_1 = 10**(n-1)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers ending with 1\n    end_with_1 = 9 * 10**(n-2)\n    \n    # Calculate the overlap: numbers that both start and end with 1\n    start_and_end_with_1 = 10**(n-2)\n    \n    # Total count\n    total = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - start_and_end_with_1\n    \n    return total\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Special Case for n=1**: If n is 1, the only 1-digit number that starts or ends with 1 is 1 itself.\n- **General Case**: For n > 1, we calculate the numbers starting with 1, ending with 1, and adjust for the overlap where numbers both start and end with 1.
