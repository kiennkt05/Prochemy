{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we need to consider two main cases:\n\n1. **Numbers that start with 1**: These are numbers of the form `1xxxx...` where `x` can be any digit from 0 to 9. For an n-digit number, the first digit is fixed as 1, and the remaining `n-1` digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) such numbers.\n\n2. **Numbers that end with 1**: These are numbers of the form `xxxx...1` where `x` can be any digit from 0 to 9. For an n-digit number, the last digit is fixed as 1, and the remaining `n-1` digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Therefore, there are \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) such numbers.\n\nHowever, numbers that both start and end with 1 (i.e., `1xxxx...1`) are counted twice in the above two cases.
