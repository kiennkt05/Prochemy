{"task_id": "HumanEval/93", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function `encode` that performs two main operations on the input message:\n\n1. Swap the case of all letters in the message.\n2. Replace all vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Swap Case**: We can use Python's built-in string method `swapcase()` to change uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n\n2. **Replace Vowels**: We need to identify vowels and replace them with the letter two positions ahead. For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'e' becomes 'g', etc. We can use a dictionary to map each vowel to its corresponding replacement.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef encode(message):\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the encoded characters\n    encoded_message = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the message\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap the case of the character\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # If the swapped character is a vowel, replace it\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vowel Replacement Mapping**: We use a dictionary to map each vowel to its replacement. This allows for quick lookup and replacement.\n- **Case Swapping**: We use `swapcase()` to change the case of each character.\n- **Character Processing**: For each character, we first swap its case, then check if it's a vowel (after swapping). If it is, we replace it using our dictionary; otherwise, we keep the swapped character.\n- **Output**: We collect all processed characters in a list and join them into a single string to form the final encoded message.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the requirements and should work correctly for any input message consisting of letters.", "completion": "def encode(message):\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the encoded characters\n    encoded_message = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the message\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap the case of the character\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # If the swapped character is a vowel, replace it\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'", "result": "passed", "passed": true}
