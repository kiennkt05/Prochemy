The task description is a bit ambiguous, so I'll assume that the list is divided into sublists of a fixed size, and each of these sublists needs to be reversed. If the list size is not a multiple of the sublist size, the last sublist may be smaller.\n\nLet's assume a sublist size of 3 for this example. If you have a different sublist size in mind, please let me know.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int], sublist_size: int = 3) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses each sublist of a given size within the list of integers.\n    \n    :param data: List of integers to be processed.\n    :param sublist_size: The size of each sublist to reverse.\n    :return: A new list with each sublist reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Result list to store the reversed sublists\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the list in steps of sublist_size\n    for i in range(0, len(data), sublist_size):\n        # Extract the current sublist\n        sublist = data[i:i + sublist_size]\n        # Reverse the sublist and add it to the result\n        result.extend(sublist[::-1])\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(reverse_sublists(data))  # Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `reverse_sublists` takes a list of integers `data` and an optional `sublist_size` parameter, which defaults to 3.\n- It iterates over the list in chunks of `sublist_size`.\n- For each chunk, it reverses the sublist and appends it to the result list.\n- Finally, it returns the result list with all sublists reversed.\n\nThis implementation assumes a default sublist size of 3, but you can adjust the `sublist_size` parameter to fit your specific needs. If you have a different requirement for how sublists should be defined or reversed, please provide more details.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int], sublist_size: int = 3) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses each sublist of a given size within the list of integers.\n    \n    :param data: List of integers to be processed.\n    :param sublist_size: The size of each sublist to reverse.\n    :return: A new list with each sublist reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Result list to store the reversed sublists\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the list in steps of sublist_size\n    for i in range(0, len(data), sublist_size):\n        # Extract the current sublist\n        sublist = data[i:i + sublist_size]\n        # Reverse the sublist and add it to the result\n        result.extend(sublist[::-1])\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nprint(reverse_sublists(data))  # Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10]"}
