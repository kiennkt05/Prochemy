For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'e' becomes 'g', etc.\n\n3. **Iterate and Transform:** Process each character in the message, applying the transformations as needed.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `encode` function:\n\n```python\ndef encode(message):\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Swap case and replace vowels\n    encoded_message = []\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap the case of the character\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # Replace the vowel if it is in the mapping\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vowel Replacement Mapping:** We create a dictionary `vowel_replacement` that maps each vowel to its corresponding replacement character. This includes both lowercase and uppercase vowels to handle the swapped case.\n\n- **Character Processing:** We iterate over each character in the input message. For each character, we first swap its case using `swapcase()`. Then, we check if the swapped character is a vowel that needs to be replaced using our dictionary. If it is, we append the replacement character to our result list; otherwise, we append the swapped character as is.\n\n- **Result Construction:** Finally, we join the list of processed characters into a single string and return it as the encoded message.\n\nThis approach ensures that the message is encoded correctly according to the specified rules.", "completion": "def encode(message):\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Swap case and replace vowels\n    encoded_message = []\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap the case of the character\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # Replace the vowel if it is in the mapping\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'"}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/77", "response": "To solve the problem of determining whether a given integer `a` is a perfect cube of some integer, we need to check if there exists an integer `n` such that \\( n^3 = a \\). Here's a step-by-step approach to implement this:\n\n1. **Handle Edge Cases**: \n   - If `a` is 0, it is trivially a cube (since \\( 0^3 = 0 \\)).\n   - If `a` is 1 or -1, both are cubes of 1 and -1 respectively.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Values**:\n   - For positive `a`, iterate over possible values of `n` from 0 up to the cube root of `a`.\n   - For negative `a`, iterate over possible values of `n` from the cube root of `a` (negative) up to 0.\n\n3. **Check for Cube**:\n   - For each `n`, check if \\( n^3 = a \\). If true, return `True`.\n   - If no such `n` is found, return `False`.\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n   - Use integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.\n   - Use the `abs()` function to handle both positive and negative values of `a`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef iscube(a):\n    # Handle the case where a is 0\n    if a == 0:\n        return True\n    \n    # Calculate the absolute value of a to handle negative numbers\n    abs_a = abs(a)\n    \n    # Calculate the integer cube root of the absolute value of a\n    # We use int(abs_a ** (1/3)) to get the approximate cube root\n    # and check the range around it to ensure we find the exact cube root if it exists\n    n = int(abs_a ** (1/3))\n    \n    # Check if n^3 or (n+1)^3 or (n-1)^3 equals abs_a\n    # This is to account for any rounding issues with the cube root calculation\n    if n**3 == abs_a or (n+1)**3 == abs_a or (n-1)**3 == abs_a:\n        return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(iscube(1))    # True\nprint(iscube(2))    # False\nprint(iscube(-1))   # True\nprint(iscube(64))   # True\nprint(iscube(0))    # True\nprint(iscube(180))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Cube Root Calculation**: We use `abs_a ** (1/3)` to estimate the cube root.
