This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement the function:\n\n1. Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n using the formula: `n * (n + 1) // 2`.\n2. Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the list.\n3. The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_number(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a list containing numbers from 0 to n.\n\n    Args:\n    nums (List[int]): A list of integers from 0 to n with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The missing number.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)\n    # Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    # Calculate the actual sum of numbers in the list\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    # The missing number is the difference between the expected and actual sums\n    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage:\n# nums = [3, 0, 1]\n# The missing number is 2\n# print(find_missing_number(nums))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Expected Sum Calculation**: The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` gives the sum of the first n natural numbers. This is a well-known formula that efficiently computes the sum without iteration.\n- **Actual Sum Calculation**: We use Python's built-in `sum()` function to compute the sum of the numbers in the list.\n- **Finding the Missing Number**: The missing number is simply the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\nThis approach runs in O(n) time complexity and uses O(1) additional space, making it both efficient and straightforward.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_number(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a list containing numbers from 0 to n.\n\n    Args:\n    nums (List[int]): A list of integers from 0 to n with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The missing number.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)\n    # Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    # Calculate the actual sum of numbers in the list\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    # The missing number is the difference between the expected and actual sums\n    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage:\n# nums = [3, 0, 1]\n# The missing number is 2\n# print(find_missing_number(nums))  # Output: 2"}

{"task_id": "HumanEval/32", "response": "To implement the `find_zero` function, we need to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients in the list `xs`. The task description suggests that the polynomial will have an even number of coefficients and that the largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/93", "response": "To implement the `encode` function as described, we need to perform two main operations on the input message:\n\n1. **Swap the case** of all letters in the message.\n2. **Replace all vowels** with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet.\n\nHere's how we can achieve this:\n\n- For swapping the case, we can use the `str.swapcase()` method, which automatically changes uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n- For replacing vowels, we need to identify vowels and then replace them with the corresponding letter two places ahead.
