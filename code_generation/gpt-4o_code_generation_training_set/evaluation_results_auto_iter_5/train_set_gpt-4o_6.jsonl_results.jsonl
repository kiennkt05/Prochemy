{"task_id": "HumanEval/75", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number \\( a \\) (where \\( a < 100 \\)) can be expressed as the product of exactly three prime numbers. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 100:** First, we need a list of prime numbers that are less than 100.
