A sublist of consecutive integers is defined as a sequence where each number is exactly one more than the previous number. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify Sublists:** Traverse the list to identify sublists of consecutive integers.\n2. **Reverse Sublists:** Once a sublist is identified, reverse it.\n3. **Reconstruct the List:** Combine the reversed sublists and any non-consecutive elements back into a single list.\n\nLet's implement this logic in the `reverse_sublists` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if not data:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    start = 0\n\n    while start < len(data):\n        # Find the end of the current sublist of consecutive numbers\n        end = start\n        while end + 1 < len(data) and data[end + 1] == data[end] + 1:\n            end += 1\n        \n        # Reverse the sublist from start to end\n        if end > start:\n            result.extend(data[start:end+1][::-1])\n        else:\n            result.append(data[start])\n        \n        # Move to the next potential sublist\n        start = end + 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# data = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]\n# print(reverse_sublists(data))  # Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization:** We start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list.\n- **Loop through the list:** We use a `while` loop to iterate through the list, identifying sublists of consecutive numbers.\n- **Identify sublists:** For each element, we check if the next element is consecutive. If it is, we continue to extend the sublist.\n- **Reverse and append:** Once a sublist is identified, we reverse it and append it to the result list. If no sublist is found (i.e., a single element), we simply append the element.\n- **Move to the next element:** We update the `start` index to move past the current sublist.\n\nThis function efficiently processes the list to reverse all sublists of consecutive integers, ensuring the output is as expected.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if not data:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    start = 0\n\n    while start < len(data):\n        # Find the end of the current sublist of consecutive numbers\n        end = start\n        while end + 1 < len(data) and data[end + 1] == data[end] + 1:\n            end += 1\n        \n        # Reverse the sublist from start to end\n        if end > start:\n            result.extend(data[start:end+1][::-1])\n        else:\n            result.append(data[start])\n        \n        # Move to the next potential sublist\n        start = end + 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# data = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]\n# print(reverse_sublists(data))  # Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8]"}

{"task_id": "HumanEval/32", "response": "To solve the problem of finding a zero of a polynomial given its coefficients, we can use numerical methods.
