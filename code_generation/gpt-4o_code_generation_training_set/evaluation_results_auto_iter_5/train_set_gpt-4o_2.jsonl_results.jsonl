Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Handle Negative and Zero Values:** Since the cube of a negative number is negative, we need to consider both positive and negative roots. Zero is a special case where `0^3 = 0`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Roots:** We can iterate over possible integer values of `n` from the negative cube root of `a` to the positive cube root of `a`. This ensures we cover all possible integer values that could potentially satisfy the condition `n^3 = a`.\n\n3. **Check for Perfect Cube:** For each integer `n` in this range, check if `n^3` equals `a`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `iscube` function:\n\n```python\ndef iscube(a):\n    '''\n    Determine if the integer a is a perfect cube of some integer.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    a (int): The integer to check.\n    \n    Returns:\n    bool: True if a is a perfect cube, False otherwise.\n    '''\n    # Handle the special case where a is 0\n    if a == 0:\n        return True\n    \n    # Calculate the absolute value of the cube root of a\n    abs_a = abs(a)\n    # Calculate the integer cube root range to check\n    n = int(abs_a ** (1/3))\n    \n    # Check the range from -n to n\n    for i in range(-n-1, n+2):\n        if i**3 == a:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(iscube(1))    # True\nprint(iscube(2))    # False\nprint(iscube(-1))   # True\nprint(iscube(64))   # True\nprint(iscube(0))    # True\nprint(iscube(180))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Cube Root Calculation:** We calculate the cube root of the absolute value of `a` to determine the range of potential integer roots.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **n-digit numbers**: These are numbers that have exactly `n` digits. For example, for `n = 3`, the range of numbers is from 100 to 999.\n\n2. **Start or end with 1**: We need to count numbers that either start with 1 or end with 1, or both.\n\n3. **Avoid double-counting**: Numbers that both start and end with 1 should only be counted once.\n\nHere's how we can approach the problem:\n\n- **Count numbers starting with 1**: For an n-digit number starting with 1, the first digit is fixed as 1, and the remaining `n-1` digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Thus, there are \\(10^{n-1}\\) such numbers.\n\n- **Count numbers ending with 1**: Similarly, for an n-digit number ending with 1, the last digit is fixed as 1, and the first `n-1` digits can be any digit from 1 to 9 (the first digit cannot be 0 for an n-digit number). Thus, there are \\(9 \\times 10^{n-2}\\) such numbers.\n\n- **Count numbers starting and ending with 1**: For numbers that both start and end with 1, the first and last digits are fixed as 1, and the middle `n-2` digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Thus, there are \\(10^{n-2}\\) such numbers.\n\n- **Total count**: The total count is the sum of numbers starting with 1 and numbers ending with 1, minus the numbers that both start and end with 1 to avoid double-counting.\n\nLet's implement this logic in the function:\n\n```python\ndef starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        # Special case for 1-digit numbers: only 1 satisfies the condition\n        return 1\n    \n    # Count of numbers starting with 1\n    start_with_1 = 10**(n-1)\n    \n    # Count of numbers ending with 1\n    end_with_1 = 9 * 10**(n-2)\n    \n    # Count of numbers starting and ending with 1\n    start_and_end_with_1 = 10**(n-2)\n    \n    # Total count\n    total_count = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - start_and_end_with_1\n    \n    return total_count\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(starts_one_ends(2))  # Output: 18\nprint(starts_one_ends(3))  # Output: 180\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- For `n = 1`, the only number is 1 itself, so the count is 1.\n- For `n = 2`, numbers starting with 1 are 10 to 19 (10 numbers), and numbers ending with 1 are 11, 21, ..., 91 (9 numbers).
