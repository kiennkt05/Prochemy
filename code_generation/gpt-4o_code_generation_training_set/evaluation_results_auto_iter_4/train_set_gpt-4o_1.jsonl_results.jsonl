Zero is a special case where \\( 0^3 = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Roots**: We can iterate over possible integer values of `n` from the negative cube root of `a` to the positive cube root of `a`. This ensures we cover all possible integer roots.\n\n3. **Check for Perfect Cube**: For each integer `n` in this range, check if \\( n^3 = a \\).\n\n4. **Return Result**: If such an `n` is found, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `iscube` function:\n\n```python\ndef iscube(a):\n    '''\n    Determine if the integer a is a perfect cube of some integer.\n    '''\n    # Handle the case where a is zero\n    if a == 0:\n        return True\n    \n    # Calculate the absolute value of the cube root of a\n    abs_a = abs(a)\n    # Calculate the integer cube root of the absolute value\n    n = int(round(abs_a ** (1/3)))\n    \n    # Check if n^3 equals the absolute value of a\n    if n**3 == abs_a:\n        return True\n    \n    # Check the negative counterpart if a is negative\n    if (-n)**3 == a:\n        return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(iscube(1))    # True\nprint(iscube(2))    # False\nprint(iscube(-1))   # True\nprint(iscube(64))   # True\nprint(iscube(0))    # True\nprint(iscube(180))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Zero Case**: Directly return `True` if `a` is zero.\n- **Cube Root Calculation**: We calculate the cube root of the absolute value of `a` and round it to the nearest integer.
