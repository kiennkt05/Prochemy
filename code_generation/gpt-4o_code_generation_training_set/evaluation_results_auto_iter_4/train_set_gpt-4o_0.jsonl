This mapping is case-sensitive to handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.\n- **Character Transformation:** For each character in the input message, we first swap its case using `swapcase()`. If the swapped character is a vowel, we replace it using the `vowel_mapping`. Otherwise, we keep the swapped character as is.\n- **Result Construction:** We collect all transformed characters in a list and join them to form the final encoded message.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the encoding as specified in the task description.", "completion": "def encode(message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Encodes a message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing\n    all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the alphabet.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    message (str): The input message consisting of only letters.\n    \n    Returns:\n    str: The encoded message.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the vowel replacement mapping\n    vowel_mapping = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the transformed characters\n    encoded_message = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the message\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap the case of the character\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # Replace the vowel if it is in the mapping\n        if swapped_char in vowel_mapping:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_mapping[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'"}
