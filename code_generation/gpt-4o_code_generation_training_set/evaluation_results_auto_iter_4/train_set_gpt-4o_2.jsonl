{"task_id": "HumanEval/93", "response": "To implement the `encode` function as described, we need to perform two main operations on the input message:\n\n1. **Swap the case** of all letters in the message.\n2. **Replace all vowels** with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet.\n\nHere's how we can achieve this:\n\n- For swapping the case, we can use the `str.swapcase()` method, which automatically changes uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n- For replacing vowels, we need to identify vowels and then replace them with the corresponding letter two places ahead. The vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and their uppercase counterparts). We can use the `chr()` and `ord()` functions to find the letter two places ahead.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef encode(message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Encodes the message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing\n    all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Swap case and replace vowels\n    encoded_message = []\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap case\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # Replace vowel if applicable\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vowel Replacement Mapping:** We create a dictionary `vowel_replacement` that maps each vowel to its corresponding letter two places ahead in the alphabet.

If it is, we replace it using our dictionary; otherwise, we keep the swapped character.\n- **Join and Return:** Finally, we join the list of transformed characters into a single string and return it.\n\nThis implementation efficiently handles the encoding as specified in the task description.", "completion": "def encode(message):\n    \"\"\"\n    Encodes the message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing\n    all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Swap case and replace vowels\n    encoded_message = []\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap case\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # Replace vowel if applicable\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'"}
