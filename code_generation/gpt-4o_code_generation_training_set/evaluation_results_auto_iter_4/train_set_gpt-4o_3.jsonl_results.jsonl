A common approach for finding roots of polynomials is to use the Newton-Raphson method, which is efficient for finding a single root.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `find_zero` function using the Newton-Raphson method:\n\n```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs.\n    The derivative of a polynomial a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + an*x^n\n    is a1 + 2*a2*x + 3*a3*x^2 + ... + n*an*x^(n-1).\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)][1:]\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list, initial_guess=0.0, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a root of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = initial_guess\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        fx = poly(xs, x)\n        if abs(fx) < tolerance:\n            return x\n        dfx = poly(derivative(xs), x)\n        if dfx == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Derivative is zero. Newton-Raphson method fails.\")\n        x -= fx / dfx\n    raise ValueError(\"Maximum iterations reached. No root found.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x, root is -0.5\n    print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3), root is 1.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Derivative Calculation**: The `derivative` function computes the derivative of the polynomial. This is necessary for the Newton-Raphson method, which requires both the function value and its derivative at each iteration.\n\n2. **Newton-Raphson Method**: The `find_zero` function uses this method to iteratively find a root. Starting from an initial guess, it updates the guess using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{new}} = x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( f(x) \\) is the polynomial and \\( f'(x) \\) is its derivative.\n\n3. **Convergence Criteria**: The method stops when the function value at the current guess is within a specified tolerance, indicating that a root has been found.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: The function raises an error if the derivative is zero (which would cause division by zero) or if the maximum number of iterations is reached without finding a root.\n\nThis implementation should work for the specified conditions and provide a reliable way to find a root of the polynomial.", "completion": "def derivative(xs: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs.\n    The derivative of a polynomial a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + an*x^n\n    is a1 + 2*a2*x + 3*a3*x^2 + ... + n*an*x^(n-1).\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)][1:]\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list, initial_guess=0.0, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a root of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = initial_guess\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        fx = poly(xs, x)\n        if abs(fx) < tolerance:\n            return x\n        dfx = poly(derivative(xs), x)\n        if dfx == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Derivative is zero.
