If it is, we return an empty list.\n- **Loop through the list:** We use a `while` loop to iterate through the list, identifying sublists of consecutive numbers.\n- **Identify sublists:** For each starting point, we find the end of the sublist where the numbers are consecutive.\n- **Reverse and append:** We reverse the identified sublist and append it to the result list.\n- **Move to the next sublist:** We update the starting point to the next element after the current sublist.\n\nThis approach ensures that each sublist of consecutive numbers is reversed, and the overall list is reconstructed correctly.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    if not data:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    start = 0\n\n    while start < len(data):\n        # Find the end of the current sublist of consecutive numbers\n        end = start\n        while end + 1 < len(data) and data[end + 1] == data[end] + 1:\n            end += 1\n\n        # Reverse the sublist from start to end\n        sublist = data[start:end + 1]\n        result.extend(sublist[::-1])\n\n        # Move to the next potential sublist\n        start = end + 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12]\nprint(reverse_sublists(data))  # Output: [3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 5, 10, 9, 12]", "result": "failed: ", "passed": false}

Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Use a Dictionary to Count Occurrences:** We'll use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the list.\n2. **Identify Duplicates:** After counting, we'll iterate through the dictionary to find numbers with a count greater than one.\n3. **Return the List of Duplicates:** Finally, we'll return a list of these duplicate numbers.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_duplicates(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    # Dictionary to store the count of each number\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each number\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in count_dict:\n            count_dict[number] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[number] = 1\n    \n    # Collect numbers that appear more than once\n    duplicates = [number for number, count in count_dict.items() if count > 1]\n    \n    return duplicates\n\n# Example usage:\n# numbers = [1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0]\n# print(find_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1.0, 2.5]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Counting Occurrences:** We iterate over each number in the input list and update its count in the `count_dict`. If the number is already in the dictionary, we increment its count; otherwise, we initialize it with a count of 1.\n- **Finding Duplicates:** We use a list comprehension to extract numbers from `count_dict` that have a count greater than 1, indicating they are duplicates.\n- **Efficiency:** This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list, due to the single pass required to count elements and another pass to filter duplicates.\n\nThis solution is robust and handles edge cases such as an empty list or a list with no duplicates gracefully.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef find_duplicates(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    # Dictionary to store the count of each number\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each number\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in count_dict:\n            count_dict[number] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[number] = 1\n    \n    # Collect numbers that appear more than once\n    duplicates = [number for number, count in count_dict.items() if count > 1]\n    \n    return duplicates\n\n# Example usage:\n# numbers = [1.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 4.0, 1.0, 5.0]\n# print(find_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1.0, 2.5]", "result": "passed", "passed": true}

A common approach for finding roots of polynomials is to use the Newton-Raphson method, which is efficient for finding a single root.\n\nHere's how you can implement the `find_zero` function using the Newton-Raphson method:\n\n```python\ndef derivative(xs: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)][1:]\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list, initial_guess=0.0, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a root of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial guess for the root\n    x = initial_guess\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        # Evaluate the polynomial and its derivative at the current guess\n        fx = poly(xs, x)\n        dfx = poly(derivative(xs), x)\n        \n        # If the derivative is zero, we cannot proceed with Newton's method\n        if dfx == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Derivative is zero. Newton-Raphson method fails.\")\n        \n        # Update the guess using Newton's method\n        x_new = x - fx / dfx\n        \n        # Check for convergence\n        if abs(x_new - x) < tolerance:\n            return x_new\n        \n        x = x_new\n    \n    # If we reach here, the method did not converge\n    raise ValueError(\"Newton-Raphson method did not converge.\")\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x, root is -0.5\n    print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3), root is 1.0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Derivative Calculation:**\n   - The `derivative` function computes the derivative of the polynomial. For a polynomial \\( a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \\ldots + a_nx^n \\), the derivative is \\( a_1 + 2a_2x + \\ldots + na_nx^{n-1} \\).\n\n2. **Newton-Raphson Method:**\n   - The method iteratively improves the guess for the root using the formula:\n     \\[\n     x_{\\text{new}} = x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\n     \\]\n   - The process continues until the change in \\( x \\) is smaller than a specified tolerance, indicating convergence.\n\n3. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the derivative is zero at any point, the method cannot proceed, and an exception is raised.\n   - If the method does not converge within the maximum number of iterations, an exception is raised.\n\nThis implementation should work well for finding a single root of the polynomial, given the constraints and assumptions in the task description.", "completion": "def derivative(xs: list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [i * coeff for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)][1:]\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list, initial_guess=0.0, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a root of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initial guess for the root\n    x = initial_guess\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        # Evaluate the polynomial and its derivative at the current guess\n        fx = poly(xs, x)\n        dfx = poly(derivative(xs), x)\n        \n        # If the derivative is zero, we cannot proceed with Newton's method\n        if dfx == 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Derivative is zero.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/93", "response": "To implement the `encode` function as described, we need to perform two main operations on the input message:\n\n1. **Swap the case** of all letters in the message.\n2. **Replace all vowels** with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet.\n\nHere's how we can achieve this:\n\n- For swapping the case, we can use the `str.swapcase()` method, which automatically converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n- For replacing vowels, we need to identify vowels and replace them with the corresponding letter two places ahead. For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'e' becomes 'g', etc. We can use a dictionary to map each vowel to its replacement.\n\nLet's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef encode(message):\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Swap case and replace vowels\n    encoded_message = []\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap case\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        # Replace vowel if applicable\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vowel Replacement Mapping:** We create a dictionary `vowel_replacement` that maps each vowel to the letter two places ahead in the alphabet. This includes both lowercase and uppercase vowels.\n- **Swapping and Replacing:** We iterate over each character in the message, swap its case, and check if it's a vowel that needs replacement. If it is, we replace it using our dictionary; otherwise, we keep the swapped character.\n- **Building the Result:** We collect all processed characters in a list and join them into a single string to form the final encoded message.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the requirements and edge cases, such as mixed case input and non-vowel characters.", "completion": "def encode(message):\n    # Define a mapping for vowels to their replacements\n    vowel_replacement = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Swap case and replace vowels\n    encoded_message = []\n    for char in message:\n        # Swap case\n        swapped_char = char.swapcase()\n        # Replace vowel if applicable\n        if swapped_char in vowel_replacement:\n            encoded_message.append(vowel_replacement[swapped_char])\n        else:\n            encoded_message.append(swapped_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Expected: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'", "result": "passed", "passed": true}
