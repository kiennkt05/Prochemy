If the assertion passes, a success message is printed.\n\n### Note:\n- The Comb Sort algorithm is generally more efficient than Bubble Sort, especially for larger lists, due to its ability to eliminate small values at the end of the list more quickly."}

Since sets do not allow duplicate values, this effectively removes any duplicates from the input.\n- The function then compares the length of the set (which contains only unique elements) to the length of the original tuple. If they are equal, it means there were no duplicates, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n- The script includes assertions to test the function against various cases, including the provided test case.

The function is followed by an assertion to test its correctness.\n\n```python\ndef check_K(tup, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the given tuple contains the specified value k.\n\n    Parameters:\n    tup (tuple): The tuple to check.\n    k (any): The value to search for in the tuple.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if k is found in the tuple, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return k in tup\n\n# Test the function with the provided assertion\nassert check_K((10, 4, 5, 6, 8), 6) == True\n\n# Additional test cases for verification\nassert check_K((1, 2, 3), 2) == True\nassert check_K((1, 2, 3), 4) == False\nassert check_K((), 1) == False  # Testing with an empty tuple\nassert check_K((None, True, 3.14), True) == True  # Testing with different types\n\nprint(\"All tests passed!\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `check_K` takes a tuple `tup` and a value `k` as arguments.\n- It checks if `k` is present in `tup` using the `in` keyword, which is efficient and straightforward.\n- The assertion provided in the task checks if the function correctly identifies that `6` is in the tuple `(10, 4, 5, 6, 8)`.\n- Additional test cases are included to ensure the function works with various scenarios, including an empty tuple and different data types.\n- The script prints \"All tests passed!\" if all assertions are successful, indicating that the function behaves as expected."}
{"task_id": "Mbpp/809", "solution": "Here is a self-contained Python script that defines a function to check if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple. The script includes the required assertion to test the function.\n\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if each element of the second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.\n\n    Parameters:\n    tuple1 (tuple): The first tuple containing elements to compare against.\n    tuple2 (tuple): The second tuple containing elements to check.\n\n    Returns:\n    bool: True if all elements in tuple2 are smaller than those in tuple1, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if both tuples are of the same length\n    if len(tuple1) != len(tuple2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both tuples must be of the same length.\")\n\n    # Compare each element of the tuples\n    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        if not (b < a):\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Test the function with the provided assertion\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)) == False\n\n# Additional test cases\nassert check_smaller((5, 6, 7), (1, 2, 3)) == True\nassert check_smaller((1, 1, 1), (0, 0, 0)) == True\nassert check_smaller((1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3)) == False\nassert check_smaller((10, 20, 30), (5, 15, 25)) == True\n\nprint(\"All tests passed!\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `check_smaller` function takes two tuples as input.\n- It first checks if both tuples are of the same length; if not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n- It then iterates through both tuples simultaneously using `zip` and compares each corresponding pair of elements.\n- If any element in the second tuple is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, the function returns `False`.\n- If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, it returns `True`.\n- The script includes assertions to test the function with various cases, ensuring it behaves as expected."}
