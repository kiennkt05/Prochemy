{"task_id": "Mbpp/109", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to rotate a given binary string a specified number of times and count how many of these rotations result in an odd integer value when the binary string is interpreted as a binary number.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Rotate the Binary String:** For each rotation, move the first character of the string to the end.\n2. **Convert to Integer:** Convert the rotated binary string to an integer.\n3. **Check for Oddness:** Determine if the integer is odd by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is 1.\n4. **Count Odd Values:** Keep a count of how many of these integers are odd.\n\nBelow is the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes a binary string and a number of rotations,\n    and returns the count of rotations that result in an odd integer value.\n    \n    :param binary_string: A string representing a binary number.\n    :param rotations: An integer representing the number of rotations to perform.\n    :return: The count of odd integer values from the rotations.\n    \"\"\"\n    odd_count = 0\n    length = len(binary_string)\n    \n    # Perform the rotations\n    for i in range(rotations):\n        # Rotate the string\n        rotated_string = binary_string[i % length:] + binary_string[:i % length]\n        \n        # Convert the rotated binary string to an integer\n        number = int(rotated_string, 2)\n        \n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 == 1:\n            odd_count += 1\n    \n    return odd_count\n\n# Test the function with the provided test case\nassert odd_Equivalent(\"011001\", 6) == 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Rotation Logic:** The rotation is achieved by slicing the string. For each rotation `i`, the string is split into two parts: from index `i % length` to the end, and from the start to index `i % length`. These parts are then concatenated in reverse order to simulate the rotation.\n- **Odd Check:** After converting the rotated string to an integer, we check if it is odd using the modulus operator `%`.\n- **Counting Odds:** We maintain a counter `odd_count` to keep track of how many of the rotated numbers are odd.\n\nThis code is designed to handle the specified number of rotations and correctly count the number of odd results, as demonstrated by the test case."}

{"task_id": "Mbpp/235", "solution": "To solve the problem of setting all even bits of a given number, we need to understand what \"even bits\" means in the context of binary representation. In binary, bit positions are typically indexed starting from 0 (rightmost bit) to n-1 (leftmost bit), where n is the number of bits. Even bit positions are those at indices 0, 2, 4, etc.\n\nThe task is to set these even bit positions to 1 for a given integer. Here's a Python function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Set all even bits of the given number to 1.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The input number.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number with all even bits set to 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize a mask with all even bits set to 1\n    mask = 0\n    bit_position = 0\n    \n    # We assume a 32-bit integer for the mask\n    # You can adjust the range for different bit lengths\n    for i in range(0, 32, 2):\n        mask |= (1 << i)\n    \n    # Set the even bits of n using the mask\n    return n | mask\n\n# Test the function with the given assertion\nassert even_bit_set_number(10) == 10\n\n# Additional test cases\nprint(even_bit_set_number(0))  # Expected output: 1431655765 (0b01010101010101010101010101010101)\nprint(even_bit_set_number(1))  # Expected output: 1431655765\nprint(even_bit_set_number(2))  # Expected output: 1431655767\nprint(even_bit_set_number(3))  # Expected output: 1431655767\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Mask Creation:** We create a mask where all even bit positions are set to 1. This is done by iterating over even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 30) and setting the corresponding bit in the mask using bitwise OR (`|`) and left shift (`<<`).\n\n- **Applying the Mask:** We use the bitwise OR operation between the input number `n` and the mask. This operation sets all even bits of `n` to 1, as required.\n\n- **Assumptions:** The code assumes a 32-bit integer for the mask, which is typical for many systems. If you need to handle larger integers, you can adjust the range in the loop accordingly.\n\nThis function is efficient and works correctly for the given problem statement."}

The function will calculate the third side accordingly.\n\nHere's the Python script to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef otherside_rightangle(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the third side of a right-angled triangle given two sides.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    a (float): Length of the first side.\n    b (float): Length of the second side.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: Length of the third side.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse\n    if a > b:\n        # a is the hypotenuse\n        third_side = math.sqrt(a**2 - b**2)\n    else:\n        # b is the hypotenuse\n        third_side = math.sqrt(b**2 - a**2)\n    \n    return third_side\n\n# Test the function with the provided assertion\nassert math.isclose(otherside_rightangle(7, 8), 10.63014581273465, rel_tol=1e-9)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(otherside_rightangle(7, 8))  # Output: 10.63014581273465\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `otherside_rightangle` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which represent the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle.\n- It checks which of the two sides is longer to determine if it is the hypotenuse.\n- If `a` is greater than `b`, it assumes `a` is the hypotenuse and calculates the third side using the formula: \\(\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2}\\).\n- If `b` is greater than `a`, it assumes `b` is the hypotenuse and calculates the third side using the formula: \\(\\sqrt{b^2 - a^2}\\).\n- The function returns the calculated length of the third side.\n- The `assert` statement checks that the function returns the expected result for the given test case, using `math.isclose` to handle floating-point precision issues."}

The merge sort algorithm is naturally suited for this task because it divides the array into smaller subarrays, counts inversions in these subarrays, and then counts inversions across the subarrays during the merge step.\n  \n- **Counting Inversions**: During the merge step, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates that all remaining elements in the left subarray form inversions with this element from the right subarray.\n\n- **Efficiency**: This approach runs in O(n log n) time, which is efficient for large arrays compared to the naive O(n^2) approach."}

It allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The idea is to arrange the list of elements so that, starting anywhere, taking every `gap`th element produces a sorted list. Such a list is said to be `h-sorted`. The algorithm uses a sequence of gaps, which are reduced in size until they reach 1, at which point the list is fully sorted.\n- **Gap Sequence**: The gap sequence starts at half the length of the list and is halved each time until it reaches 1.\n- **Gapped Insertion Sort**: For each gap, the algorithm performs a gapped insertion sort, which is similar to the standard insertion sort but with elements that are `gap` positions apart.\n- **Efficiency**: Shell sort is more efficient than simple quadratic sorting algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort, especially for larger lists."}

{"task_id": "Mbpp/468", "solution": "To solve the problem of finding the maximum product formed by multiplying numbers of an increasing subsequence in an array, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to maintain a list where each element at index `i` stores the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at that index. We then iterate through the array, updating this list based on previous values.\n\nHere's the Python script that implements this solution:\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the maximum product of increasing subsequences\n    max_product_dp = arr[:]  # Start with each element as the max product of its own subsequence\n\n    # Iterate over the array to fill the max_product_dp list\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n                # Update the max product for the subsequence ending at i\n                max_product_dp[i] = max(max_product_dp[i], max_product_dp[j] * arr[i])\n\n    # The result is the maximum value in the max_product_dp list\n    return max(max_product_dp)\n\n# Test the function with the provided test case\nassert max_product([3, 100, 4, 5, 150, 6]) == 3000\n\n# Additional test cases\nprint(max_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: 24 (1*2*3*4)\nprint(max_product([10, 5, 4, 3]))  # Expected output: 10 (only one element can be taken)\nprint(max_product([3, 2, 5, 10, 7]))  # Expected output: 70 (3*5*10)\nprint(max_product([1, 101, 2, 3, 100, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: 10100 (1*2*3*100)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization:** We start by creating a list `max_product_dp` that initially contains the same elements as the input array. This list will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at each index.\n  \n- **Dynamic Programming Update:** For each element `arr[i]`, we check all previous elements `arr[j]` (where `j < i`). If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]`, it means we can extend the increasing subsequence ending at `j` by including `arr[i]`. We update `max_product_dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the product of `max_product_dp[j]` and `arr[i]`.\n\n- **Result:** The maximum value in `max_product_dp` gives the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the desired result with a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the input array."}

If it is, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.\n\n4. **Result**: The largest value in the `dp` array gives the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the largest divisible subset by leveraging sorting and dynamic programming, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal."}

Therefore, the area of the largest inscribed triangle is:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r = \\frac{r^2}{2} \\]\n\nThe function should also handle the case where the radius is negative by returning `None`, as a negative radius does not make sense in this context.\n\nHere is the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(radius):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    radius (float): The radius of the semicircle.\n    \n    Returns:\n    float: The area of the largest inscribed triangle, or None if the radius is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    # The largest triangle is a right triangle with base and height equal to the radius\n    return (radius ** 2) / 2\n\n# Test cases\nassert triangle_area(-1) == None\nassert triangle_area(0) == 0\nassert triangle_area(1) == 0.5\nassert triangle_area(2) == 2\nassert triangle_area(3) == 4.5\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `triangle_area` takes a single argument `radius`.\n- It first checks if the radius is negative. If so, it returns `None`.\n- If the radius is non-negative, it calculates the area of the largest inscribed triangle using the formula \\(\\frac{r^2}{2}\\).\n- The function is tested with several test cases, including the edge case of a negative radius."}
