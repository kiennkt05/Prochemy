Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Use a Set for Tracking**: We'll use a set to keep track of numbers we've already seen. Sets are ideal for this purpose because they provide O(1) average time complexity for lookups and insertions.\n\n2. **Identify Duplicates**: As we iterate through the list, we'll check if a number is already in the set. If it is, it's a duplicate, and we'll add it to a separate set of duplicates. If it's not, we'll add it to the set of seen numbers.\n\n3. **Return the Duplicates**: Finally, we'll convert the set of duplicates to a list and return it. Using a set for duplicates ensures that each duplicate number is only listed once, even if it appears multiple times in the input list.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_duplicates(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    seen = set()  # Set to track numbers we've seen\n    duplicates = set()  # Set to track duplicates\n\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in seen:\n            duplicates.add(number)  # Add to duplicates if already seen\n        else:\n            seen.add(number)  # Add to seen if not already there\n\n    return list(duplicates)  # Convert set to list for the result\n\n# Example usage:\n# numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0]\n# print(find_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1.0, 2.0]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sets**: We use two sets, `seen` and `duplicates`. `seen` keeps track of all numbers we've encountered, while `duplicates` stores numbers that appear more than once.\n- **Efficiency**: The use of sets ensures that our solution is efficient, with average O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the input list.\n- **Output**: The function returns a list of duplicates, ensuring each duplicate number appears only once in the output, regardless of how many times it appears in the input list.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef find_duplicates(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n    seen = set()  # Set to track numbers we've seen\n    duplicates = set()  # Set to track duplicates\n\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in seen:\n            duplicates.add(number)  # Add to duplicates if already seen\n        else:\n            seen.add(number)  # Add to seen if not already there\n\n    return list(duplicates)  # Convert set to list for the result\n\n# Example usage:\n# numbers = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 1.0]\n# print(find_duplicates(numbers))  # Output: [1.0, 2.0]", "result": "passed", "passed": true}

One set is moving from left to right, and the other set is moving from right to left. All cars move at the same speed, and they are infinitely sturdy, meaning they continue moving after a collision.\n\n2. **Collision Definition**: A collision occurs when a car from the left-to-right set meets a car from the right-to-left set. Since all cars are moving at the same speed and are infinitely sturdy, each car from the left-to-right set will collide with each car from the right-to-left set exactly once.\n\n3. **Number of Collisions**: Since each car from the left-to-right set will collide with each car from the right-to-left set, the total number of collisions is simply the product of the number of cars in each set, which is `n * n`.\n\nGiven this understanding, the function can be implemented as follows:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.\n\n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number of cars in each set.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The total number of collisions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Each car from the left-to-right set will collide with each car from the right-to-left set.\n    # Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n.\n    return n * n\n\n# Example usage:\n# If there are 3 cars in each set, the number of collisions will be 3 * 3 = 9.\nprint(car_race_collision(3))  # Output: 9\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Signature**: The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars in each set.\n- **Return Value**: It returns the total number of collisions, which is `n * n`.\n- **Example**: If `n = 3`, there are 3 cars in each set, resulting in `3 * 3 = 9` collisions.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(1) since it involves a simple arithmetic operation.
