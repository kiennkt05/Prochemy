The task description is a bit ambiguous, so I'll assume that the list is divided into sublists of a fixed size, and each of these sublists needs to be reversed. If the list size is not a multiple of the sublist size, the last sublist may be smaller.\n\nLet's assume a sublist size of 3 for this implementation. If you have a different sublist size in mind, please let me know.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int], sublist_size: int = 3) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses each sublist of a given size within the list of integers.\n    \n    :param data: List of integers to be processed.\n    :param sublist_size: The size of each sublist to reverse.\n    :return: A new list with each sublist reversed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Result list to store the reversed sublists\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the list in steps of sublist_size\n    for i in range(0, len(data), sublist_size):\n        # Extract the sublist\n        sublist = data[i:i + sublist_size]\n        # Reverse the sublist and add to the result\n        result.extend(sublist[::-1])\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nprint(reverse_sublists(data))  # Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Parameters**: The function takes a list of integers `data` and an optional `sublist_size` parameter, which defaults to 3.\n- **Looping**: We loop through the list in increments of `sublist_size` to process each sublist.\n- **Reversing Sublists**: For each sublist, we reverse it using slicing (`sublist[::-1]`) and append it to the result list.\n- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where the list length is not a multiple of `sublist_size` by simply reversing whatever elements are left in the last sublist.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that each sublist is reversed as required.
