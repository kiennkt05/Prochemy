Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: We'll need a list to store the final result and a temporary list to collect consecutive numbers.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the List**: As we iterate through the input list, we'll check if the current number is consecutive to the previous one. If it is, we add it to the temporary list. If not, we reverse the temporary list (if it has more than one element) and add it to the result list, then start a new temporary list with the current number.\n\n3. **Handle the Last Sublist**: After the loop, we need to ensure that the last collected sublist is also reversed and added to the result list.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the result list which contains all reversed sublists.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `reverse_sublists` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Result list to store the final output\n    result = []\n    # Temporary list to store the current sublist of consecutive numbers\n    temp = []\n\n    for i in range(len(data)):\n        # If temp is empty or the current number is consecutive to the last number in temp\n        if not temp or data[i] == temp[-1] + 1:\n            temp.append(data[i])\n        else:\n            # Reverse the current sublist if it has more than one element\n            if len(temp) > 1:\n                result.extend(reversed(temp))\n            else:\n                result.extend(temp)\n            # Start a new sublist with the current number\n            temp = [data[i]]\n\n    # Handle the last sublist\n    if len(temp) > 1:\n        result.extend(reversed(temp))\n    else:\n        result.extend(temp)\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]\n# Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8]\nprint(reverse_sublists([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We start with an empty `result` list and an empty `temp` list.\n- **Loop Through Data**: For each element, we check if it can be added to the current sublist of consecutive numbers.\n- **Reverse and Append**: When a non-consecutive number is encountered, we reverse the current sublist (if applicable) and append it to the result.\n- **Final Sublist**: After the loop, we ensure the last sublist is processed.\n- **Return**: The function returns the `result` list containing all reversed sublists.\n\nThis code efficiently handles the task of reversing sublists of consecutive integers in a given list.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef reverse_sublists(data: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    # Result list to store the final output\n    result = []\n    # Temporary list to store the current sublist of consecutive numbers\n    temp = []\n\n    for i in range(len(data)):\n        # If temp is empty or the current number is consecutive to the last number in temp\n        if not temp or data[i] == temp[-1] + 1:\n            temp.append(data[i])\n        else:\n            # Reverse the current sublist if it has more than one element\n            if len(temp) > 1:\n                result.extend(reversed(temp))\n            else:\n                result.extend(temp)\n            # Start a new sublist with the current number\n            temp = [data[i]]\n\n    # Handle the last sublist\n    if len(temp) > 1:\n        result.extend(reversed(temp))\n    else:\n        result.extend(temp)\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]\n# Output: [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 10, 9, 8]\nprint(reverse_sublists([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]))", "result": "failed: ", "passed": false}
