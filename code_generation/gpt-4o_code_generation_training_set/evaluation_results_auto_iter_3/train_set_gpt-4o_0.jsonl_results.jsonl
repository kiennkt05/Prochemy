Since the task specifies that the list `xs` will have an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient guarantees a solution, we can use numerical methods to find a root. A common approach for finding roots of polynomials is the Newton-Raphson method, which is efficient for this purpose.\n\nHere's how we can implement the `find_zero` function:\n\n1. **Define the Polynomial Function**: Use the `poly` function to evaluate the polynomial at a given point.\n\n2. **Define the Derivative**: Compute the derivative of the polynomial, which is necessary for the Newton-Raphson method.\n\n3. **Newton-Raphson Method**: Implement the iterative method to find a root. This involves:\n   - Starting with an initial guess.\n   - Iteratively updating the guess using the formula:  \n     \\[ x_{\\text{new}} = x_{\\text{old}} - \\frac{f(x_{\\text{old}})}{f'(x_{\\text{old}})} \\]\n   - Stopping when the change is smaller than a specified tolerance or after a maximum number of iterations.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\ndef poly(xs: list, x: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.\n    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])\n\ndef poly_derivative(xs: list, x: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the derivative of the polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.\n    return xs[1] + 2 * xs[2] * x + 3 * xs[3] * x^2 + .... n * xs[n] * x^(n-1)\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum([i * coeff * math.pow(x, i - 1) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs) if i > 0])\n\ndef find_zero(xs: list, initial_guess=0.0, tolerance=1e-7, max_iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a zero of the polynomial with coefficients xs using the Newton-Raphson method.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = initial_guess\n    for _ in range(max_iterations):\n        fx = poly(xs, x)\n        f_prime_x = poly_derivative(xs, x)\n        \n        if abs(f_prime_x) < tolerance:\n            raise ValueError(\"Derivative too small; Newton-Raphson method fails.\")\n        \n        x_new = x - fx / f_prime_x\n        \n        if abs(x_new - x) < tolerance:\n            return x_new\n        \n        x = x_new\n    \n    raise ValueError(\"Maximum iterations reached; no root found.\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2))  # f(x) = 1 + 2x\n# print(round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2))  # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`poly` Function**: Evaluates the polynomial at a given `x`.\n- **`poly_derivative` Function**: Computes the derivative of the polynomial, which is used in the Newton-Raphson method.\n- **`find_zero` Function**: Uses the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively find a root of the polynomial.
