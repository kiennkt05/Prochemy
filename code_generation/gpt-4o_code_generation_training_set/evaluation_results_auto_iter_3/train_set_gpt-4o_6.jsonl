The `round` function helps in getting the nearest integer value.\n- **Range Adjustment**: We adjust the range by subtracting 1 and adding 2 to ensure we cover all possible integer values around the estimated cube root.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient for typical integer values since it only checks a small range of potential cube roots.\n\nThis function should correctly identify whether a given integer is a perfect cube, handling both positive and negative numbers.", "completion": "def iscube(a):\n    '''\n    Determine if the integer a is a perfect cube of some integer.\n    '''\n    # Calculate the cube root range to check\n    # We use int() to ensure we are working with integer values\n    # The range is from the negative cube root to the positive cube root\n    # Adding 1 to the upper bound to include it in the range\n    for n in range(int(round(a ** (1/3))) - 1, int(round(a ** (1/3))) + 2):\n        if n ** 3 == a:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(iscube(1))    # True\nprint(iscube(2))    # False\nprint(iscube(-1))   # True\nprint(iscube(64))   # True\nprint(iscube(0))    # True\nprint(iscube(180))  # False"}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1', we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **n-digit numbers**: An n-digit number ranges from \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) to \\(10^n - 1\\).\n\n2. **Numbers starting with '1'**: \n   - The numbers that start with '1' are in the range from \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) to \\(1 \\times 10^{(n-1)} + (10^{(n-1)} - 1)\\).\n   - This gives us exactly \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) numbers.\n\n3. **Numbers ending with '1'**:\n   - The numbers that end with '1' can be represented as \\(x1\\), where \\(x\\) is an (n-1)-digit number.\n   - There are \\(9 \\times 10^{(n-2)}\\) such numbers because the first digit of \\(x\\) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's an (n-1)-digit number), and the remaining (n-2) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\n4. **Overlap**: \n   - The number \\(11\\) is counted in both categories when \\(n = 2\\).\n   - For \\(n > 2\\), the overlap is the numbers that start and end with '1', which are of the form \\(1x1\\), where \\(x\\) is an (n-2)-digit number.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/93", "response": "To solve the problem of encoding a message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Swap Case**: Use Python's built-in string method `swapcase()` to change uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.\n\n2. **Replace Vowels**: Identify vowels in the message and replace each with the letter that is two positions ahead in the alphabet.
