For each index `i`, it checks if the substring from `i` to the end is a palindrome.\n   - Once a palindromic suffix is found, it appends the reverse of the prefix (from the start of the string to `i`) to the original string to form the shortest palindrome.\n   - The function is designed to be efficient, as it only checks for palindromes in a linear fashion.\n\n3. **Test Cases**: The code includes assertions to validate the functionality of the `make_palindrome` function against various scenarios, ensuring that it behaves as expected.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis implementation provides a robust solution to the problem of creating the shortest palindrome from a given string while adhering to Python best practices. The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and maintain.", "completion": "def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Test if given string is a palindrome. \"\"\"\n    return string == string[::-1]\n\ndef make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\" \n    Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string.\n    \n    The algorithm works by:\n    - Finding the longest postfix of the supplied string that is a palindrome.\n    - Appending to the end of the string the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix.\n    \n    Args:\n        string (str): The input string to be transformed into a palindrome.\n    \n    Returns:\n        str: The shortest palindrome that starts with the input string.\n    \n    Examples:\n        >>> make_palindrome('')\n        ''\n        >>> make_palindrome('cat')\n        'catac'\n        >>> make_palindrome('cata')\n        'catac'\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(string, str):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a string.\")\n    \n    n = len(string)\n    \n    # Edge case for empty string\n    if n == 0:\n        return string\n    \n    # Find the longest palindromic suffix\n    for i in range(n):\n        if is_palindrome(string[i:]):\n            # If string[i:] is a palindrome, we need to append the reverse of string[:i]\n            return string + string[:i][::-1]\n    \n    # If no palindromic suffix is found, the entire string is non-palindromic\n    return string + string[:-1][::-1]  # This case is theoretically unreachable due to the loop\n\n# Test cases to validate the functionality\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    assert make_palindrome('') == ''\n    assert make_palindrome('cat') == 'catac'\n    assert make_palindrome('cata') == 'catac'\n    assert make_palindrome('race') == 'racecar'\n    assert make_palindrome('a') == 'a'\n    assert make_palindrome('ab') == 'aba'\n    assert make_palindrome('abc') == 'abcba'\n    \n    print(\"All test cases passed!\")"}
{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "response": "To solve the problem of counting the n-digit positive integers that start or end with the digit '1', we need to analyze the requirements and constraints carefully. \n\n### Requirements Analysis\n1. **Input**: A positive integer `n` which represents the number of digits.\n2. **Output**: The count of n-digit positive integers that either start with '1' or end with '1'.\n3. **Constraints**: \n   - An n-digit number must have its first digit non-zero (i.e., it cannot start with '0').\n   - We need to consider the cases where numbers can start with '1', end with '1', or both.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count n-digit numbers starting with '1'**:\n   - The first digit is fixed as '1'.\n   - The remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from '0' to '9', giving us \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) possibilities.\n\n2. **Count n-digit numbers ending with '1'**:\n   - The last digit is fixed as '1'.\n   -
