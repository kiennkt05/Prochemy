{"task_id": "HumanEval/94", "response": "To solve the problem of finding the largest prime number in a list of integers and returning the sum of its digits, we can break down the task into several steps:\n\n1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: We need a function to check if a number is prime.\n2. **Find the Largest Prime**: Iterate through the list to find the largest prime number.\n3. **Sum the Digits**: Once we have the largest prime, we will calculate the sum of its digits.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases**: We should consider cases where there are no prime numbers in the list.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete Python code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of the digits of a number.\"\"\"\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n\ndef skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"Find the largest prime value in the list and return the sum of its digits.\"\"\"\n    largest_prime = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to find the largest prime\n    for number in lst:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            if largest_prime is None or number > largest_prime:\n                largest_prime = number\n    \n    # If no prime number was found, return 0\n    if largest_prime is None:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Return the sum of the digits of the largest prime\n    return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)\n\n# Example test cases\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3]))  # Output: 10\nprint(skjkasdkd([1, 0, 1, 8, 2, 4597, 2, 1, 3, 40, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1]))  # Output: 25\nprint(skjkasdkd([1, 3, 1, 32, 5107, 34, 83278, 109, 163, 23, 2323, 32, 30, 1, 9, 3]))  # Output: 13\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 724, 32, 71, 99, 32, 6, 0, 5, 91, 83, 0, 5, 6]))  # Output: 11\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 81, 12, 3, 1, 21]))  # Output: 3\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]))  # Output: 7\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it finds any divisor, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\n\n2. **sum_of_digits Function**: This function converts the number to a string, iterates through each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums them up.\n\n3. **skjkasdkd Function**: This is the main function that:\n   - Initializes `largest_prime` to `None`.\n   - Iterates through the input list, checking each number for primality.\n   - Updates `largest_prime` if a larger prime is found.\n   - If no prime is found, it returns `0`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- If the list contains no prime numbers, the function returns `0`.\n- The code is structured to handle both positive and negative integers, but only positive integers are considered for primality.\n\nThis implementation is efficient and follows best practices, ensuring clarity and maintainability.", "completion": "def is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef sum_of_digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of the digits of a number.\"\"\"\n    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))\n\ndef skjkasdkd(lst):\n    \"\"\"Find the largest prime value in the list and return the sum of its digits.\"\"\"\n    largest_prime = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to find the largest prime\n    for number in lst:\n        if is_prime(number):\n            if largest_prime is None or number > largest_prime:\n                largest_prime = number\n    \n    # If no prime number was found, return 0\n    if largest_prime is None:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Return the sum of the digits of the largest prime\n    return sum_of_digits(largest_prime)\n\n# Example test cases\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2, 181, 32, 4, 32, 3, 2, 32, 324, 4, 3]))  # Output: 10\nprint(skjkasdkd([1, 0, 1, 8, 2, 4597, 2, 1, 3, 40, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1]))  # Output: 25\nprint(skjkasdkd([1, 3, 1, 32, 5107, 34, 83278, 109, 163, 23, 2323, 32, 30, 1, 9, 3]))  # Output: 13\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 724, 32, 71, 99, 32, 6, 0, 5, 91, 83, 0, 5, 6]))  # Output: 11\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 81, 12, 3, 1, 21]))  # Output: 3\nprint(skjkasdkd([0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 7]))  # Output: 7"}
