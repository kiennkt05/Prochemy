Thus, there are \\(9 \\times 10^{(n-2)}\\) such numbers.\n4. **Double Counting**: If a number both starts and ends with '1', it has the form '1...1'. The middle \\(n-2\\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9, giving us \\(10^{(n-2)}\\) such numbers. We need to subtract this from our total to avoid double counting.\n\n### Final Formula:\nThe total count of n-digit numbers that start or end with '1' can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 10^{(n-1)} + 9 \\times 10^{(n-2)} - 10^{(n-2)} \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{Total} = 10^{(n-1)} + 8 \\times 10^{(n-2)} \\]\n\n### Implementation:\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python.\n\n```python\ndef starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number of digits in the positive integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The count of n-digit integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n    \n    # Count of n-digit numbers starting with '1'\n    start_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 1)\n    \n    # Count of n-digit numbers ending with '1'\n    if n == 1:\n        end_with_1 = 1  # Only the number '1'\n    else:\n        end_with_1 = 9 * (10 ** (n - 2))\n    \n    # Count of n-digit numbers starting and ending with '1'\n    both_start_and_end_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 2) if n > 1 else 0\n    \n    # Total count\n    total_count = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - both_start_and_end_with_1\n    \n    return total_count\n\n# Example test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(starts_one_ends(1))  # Output: 1 (only the number '1')\n    print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Output: 18 (11, 21, 31, ..., 91, 01, 11, 21, ..., 91)\n    print(starts_one_ends(3))  # Output: 180 (100-199, 110, 120, ..., 190, 101, 111, ..., 191)\n    print(starts_one_ends(4))  # Output: 1800\n```\n\n### Test Cases:\n1. `starts_one_ends(1)` should return `1`.\n2. `starts_one_ends(2)` should return `18`.\n3. `starts_one_ends(3)` should return `180`.\n4. `starts_one_ends(4)` should return `1800`.\n\nThis implementation efficiently calculates the required count while handling edge cases, such as when \\( n = 1 \\).", "completion": "def starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number of digits in the positive integers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The count of n-digit integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n    \n    # Count of n-digit numbers starting with '1'\n    start_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 1)\n    \n    # Count of n-digit numbers ending with '1'\n    if n == 1:\n        end_with_1 = 1  # Only the number '1'\n    else:\n        end_with_1 = 9 * (10 ** (n - 2))\n    \n    # Count of n-digit numbers starting and ending with '1'\n    both_start_and_end_with_1 = 10 ** (n - 2) if n > 1 else 0\n    \n    # Total count\n    total_count = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - both_start_and_end_with_1\n    \n    return total_count\n\n# Example test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(starts_one_ends(1))  # Output: 1 (only the number '1')\n    print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Output: 18 (11, 21, 31, ..., 91, 01, 11, 21, ..., 91)\n    print(starts_one_ends(3))  # Output: 180 (100-199, 110, 120, ..., 190, 101, 111, ..., 191)\n    print(starts_one_ends(4))  # Output: 1800"}
