One number is missing from this range.\n\n### Approach\nA common and efficient approach to solve this problem is to use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. The sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nWe can calculate the expected sum for the range from 0 to n and subtract the actual sum of the numbers in the list. The difference will give us the missing number.\n\n### Implementation\nHere\u2019s how we can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_number(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a list of integers from 0 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n    nums (List[int]): A list of integers containing n distinct numbers from 0 to n.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The missing number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)  # The length of the list is n, meaning numbers should be from 0 to n\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Calculate the expected sum using the formula\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)  # Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the list\n    \n    # The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum\n    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage and test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test case 1: Missing number is 2\n    nums1 = [0, 1, 3]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums1))  # Output: 2\n\n    # Test case 2: Missing number is 0\n    nums2 = [1, 2, 3]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums2))  # Output: 0\n\n    # Test case 3: Missing number is 4\n    nums3 = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums3))  # Output: 4\n\n    # Test case 4: Missing number is 1\n    nums4 = [0]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums4))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `find_missing_number` takes a list of integers as input.\n2. **Calculate Expected Sum**: We calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n using the formula.\n3. **Calculate Actual Sum**: We compute the actual sum of the numbers present in the list.\n4. **Find Missing Number**: The missing number is found by subtracting the actual sum from the expected sum.\n5. **Example Usage**: The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block contains test cases to validate the function.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- If the input list is empty, the function will return 0, which is the expected missing number in that case.\n- The function assumes that the input list contains distinct integers from the range 0 to n, with exactly one number missing.\n\nThis implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it suitable for large inputs.", "completion": "from typing import List\n\ndef find_missing_number(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the missing number in a list of integers from 0 to n.\n    \n    Args:\n    nums (List[int]): A list of integers containing n distinct numbers from 0 to n.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The missing number in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)  # The length of the list is n, meaning numbers should be from 0 to n\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Calculate the expected sum using the formula\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)  # Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the list\n    \n    # The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum\n    missing_number = expected_sum - actual_sum\n    return missing_number\n\n# Example usage and test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test case 1: Missing number is 2\n    nums1 = [0, 1, 3]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums1))  # Output: 2\n\n    # Test case 2: Missing number is 0\n    nums2 = [1, 2, 3]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums2))  # Output: 0\n\n    # Test case 3: Missing number is 4\n    nums3 = [0, 1, 2, 3]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums3))  # Output: 4\n\n    # Test case 4: Missing number is 1\n    nums4 = [0]\n    print(find_missing_number(nums4))  # Output: 1", "result": "failed: ", "passed": false}
