{"task_id": "HumanEval/83", "response": "To implement the function `starts_one_ends(n)`, we need to count the n-digit positive integers that either start with the digit '1' or end with the digit '1'. \n\n### Breakdown of the Task:\n1. **Understanding n-digit Numbers**: \n   - An n-digit positive integer ranges from \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) to \\(10^n - 1\\).\n   - For example, for \\(n = 2\\), the range is from 10 to 99.\n\n2. **Counting Numbers Starting with '1'**:\n   - The n-digit numbers that start with '1' can be represented as \\(1xxxx\\) where \\(x\\) can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n   - The number of such integers is \\(10^{(n-1)}\\) because the remaining \\(n-1\\) digits can each be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\n3. **Counting Numbers Ending with '1'**:\n   - The n-digit numbers that end with '1' can be represented as \\(xxxx1\\).\n   - The first digit (most significant) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's an n-digit number), and the remaining \\(n-1\\) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n   - The count of such integers is \\(9 \\times 10^{(n-1)}\\).\n\n4. **Avoiding Double Counting**:\n   - If a number starts and ends with '1', it is counted in both previous counts.
