{"task_id": "HumanEval/41", "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions, we can leverage the fact that each car from the left will collide with each car from the right. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and continue moving as if they did not collide, the number of collisions can be calculated simply as the product of the number of cars in each direction.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:\n\n```python\ndef car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of cars in each direction (left to right and right to left).\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The total number of collisions.\n    \n    A collision occurs between each car moving left to right and each car moving right to left.\n    Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The number of cars cannot be negative.\")\n    \n    # Each car from the left will collide with each car from the right\n    collisions = n * n\n    return collisions\n\n# Example usage and test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(car_race_collision(0))  # Expected output: 0 (no cars, no collisions)\n    print(car_race_collision(1))  # Expected output: 1 (1 car from each side)\n    print(car_race_collision(2))  # Expected output: 4 (2 cars from each side)\n    print(car_race_collision(3))  # Expected output: 9 (3 cars from each side)\n    print(car_race_collision(10)) # Expected output: 100 (10 cars from each side)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n`, which represents the number of cars in each direction.\n2. **Input Validation**: It checks if `n` is negative and raises a `ValueError` if so, as the number of cars cannot be negative.\n3. **Collision Calculation**: The total number of collisions is calculated as `n * n`, since each car from the left will collide with each car from the right.\n4. **Return Value**: The function returns the total number of collisions.\n5. **Testing**: The code includes a main block with test cases to demonstrate the function's usage and validate its correctness.\n\n### How to Use:\n- Call the `car_race_collision` function with a non-negative integer argument representing the number of cars in each direction. The function will return the total number of collisions.", "completion": "def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.\n\n    Args:\n    n (int): The number of cars in each direction (left to right and right to left).\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The total number of collisions.\n    \n    A collision occurs between each car moving left to right and each car moving right to left.\n    Therefore, the total number of collisions is n * n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"The number of cars cannot be negative.\")\n    \n    # Each car from the left will collide with each car from the right\n    collisions = n * n\n    return collisions\n\n# Example usage and test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Test cases\n    print(car_race_collision(0))  # Expected output: 0 (no cars, no collisions)\n    print(car_race_collision(1))  # Expected output: 1 (1 car from each side)\n    print(car_race_collision(2))  # Expected output: 4 (2 cars from each side)\n    print(car_race_collision(3))  # Expected output: 9 (3 cars from each side)\n    print(car_race_collision(10)) # Expected output: 100 (10 cars from each side)"}
