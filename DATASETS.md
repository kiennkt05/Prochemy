# Datasets

This repository references public evaluation datasets (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP). Redistribution terms may vary. If redistribution is not permitted in your jurisdiction or by the upstream license, do not commit the raw dataset files; instead, fetch them from their sources.

- HumanEval (OpenAI): https://github.com/openai/human-eval
- MBPP: https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mbpp (links to sources)

If you keep datasets in your local clone, consider ignoring them with `.gitignore`.
